Study Design: For information on the study design, please see raw data README and text files. 

Summary Choices: The raw data was altered as specified by the Coursera assignment as well as tidy data standards.
The training and the test sets were clipped together to create one data set.
Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted.  meanFreq and gravityMean measurements were specifically excluded.
Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
Labeled the data set with descriptive variable names which came from the features text file included in the raw data. (Some of the column names were eventually separated and renamed.)
From the data set in step 4, created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Instruction List: To create the tidy data set, save the run_analysis.R file and the read it into RStudio. 

Code Book:
"activity" Range of 6.  Either "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING", "LAYING"
"subject"  Range of 30. There were 30 volunteers who participated
"set" originally from the training data set or test data set               
"signal" sensor information from the experiment (see raw data README text file) Acc data is measured in standard gravity units 'g'  Gyro data is measured in radians/second
"mean_or_std" describes what type of measurement is in the measurement column
"direction" X, Y, or Z axis
"measurement" either a mean or standard deviation measurement based on the mean_or_std column
